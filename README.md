Welcome to the Voice-Powered ChatBOT project! This chatbot application utilizes voice recognition and text-to-speech to offer an interactive and engaging user experience. Ask the bot anything using your voice and get responses spoken back to you.

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech**: Replies to you using text-to-speech.
- **Interactive Conversations**: Processes your queries and provides responses.
- **Simple Setup**: Run and interact with the bot directly from the command line.

## Requirements

- `Python` (any version)
- `speech_recognition` library
- `pyttsx3` library
- A microphone and speakers (ofc you need that or you can use the other text chat file)

3. Run it via terminal (Run the `voicebot.py` for voice mode and `chatbot.py` for text mode)
